üìò Project Report: FileTree Pro ‚Äî Smart File Tree Generator for VS Code & Cursor
üåê Overview
FileTree Pro is a premium VS Code extension that delivers a smart, user-friendly file tree generator for all programming languages, with automatic exclusions for folders like node_modules, dist, .git, .venv, and more. It integrates with GitHub Copilot for AI-powered features (e.g., file summarization, organization suggestions) when Copilot is installed; otherwise, AI features are disabled, ensuring core functionality remains accessible. Designed for developers, teams, and educators, FileTree Pro is compatible with VS Code and Cursor, offering an intuitive UI, drag-and-drop, and analytics for project navigation.

üéØ Objective
Build a smart, intuitive file tree generator that:

Visualizes project structures for all programming languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Ruby, etc.).
Excludes common folders (e.g., node_modules, dist, .git, .venv) by default.
Enhances workflows with GitHub Copilot AI features (if installed) for file analysis and suggestions.
Works seamlessly in VS Code and Cursor with a modern, accessible UI.

üîç Core Features
‚úÖ Interactive File Tree

Collapsible Tree: Displays a file tree in the Explorer panel with icons for files/folders.
Real-Time Updates: Tracks file changes using vscode.workspace.fs.watch.
Drag-and-Drop: Reorganizes files/folders interactively.
API Used: vscode.window.createTreeView, vscode.workspace.fs.

üîé Smart Search & Exclusions

Search: Find files/folders by name, extension, or content.
Default Exclusions: Ignores node_modules, dist, .git, .venv, build, out, .pyc, target, etc., configurable via FileTree Pro.exclude.
Universal Support: Works for all languages by respecting .gitignore and files.exclude.
API Used: vscode.workspace.findFiles, vscode.workspace.getConfiguration.

üìë File Details

Properties: Shows file name, size, extension, and last modified date.
Content Preview: Displays snippets for text files (e.g., .py, .js, .java).
Dependency Insights: Analyzes package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent.
API Used: vscode.workspace.fs.readFile, vscode.workspace.openTextDocument.

üì§ Export Options

Formats: Export as JSON, Markdown, SVG, or ASCII text.
Visual Snapshots: Generate PNG/SVG diagrams for documentation.
API Used: vscode.workspace.fs.writeFile, vscode.env.clipboard, vscode.commands.

ü§ñ AI-Powered Features (Copilot Only)
AI features are enabled only if GitHub Copilot is installed and active; otherwise, they are disabled.
üß† File Summarization

Summarizes file contents using Copilot‚Äôs Chat API.
Example: ‚ÄúThis main.py defines a Django view for user authentication.‚Äù
Implementation: vscode.commands.executeCommand('github.copilot.chat').

‚ú® Organization Suggestions

Suggests file restructuring (e.g., group related files, rename consistently).
Example: ‚ÄúMove utils.go to a utils folder.‚Äù
Implementation: Copilot‚Äôs Language Model API with custom prompts.

üé® Naming Suggestions

Proposes naming conventions (e.g., snake_case for Python, camelCase for Java).
Implementation: Use .copilot-instructions.md for project-specific rules.

üõ† Advanced Tools

File Watcher: Tracks changes with vscode.workspace.fs.watch.
Framework Detector: Identifies frameworks (React, Django, Spring) via file patterns or metadata.
Analytics Dashboard: Visualizes file counts, sizes, and types with Chart.js.
Sample Chart (File Type Distribution):{
"type": "pie",
"data": {
"labels": [".py", ".js", ".java", ".cpp", ".go"],
"datasets": [{
"label": "File Type Distribution",
"data": [50, 40, 30, 20, 10],
"backgroundColor": ["#4CAF50", "#2196F3", "#FFC107", "#FF5722", "#9C27B0"],
"borderWidth": 1
}]
},
"options": {
"plugins": {
"legend": { "position": "top" },
"title": { "display": true, "text": "File Type Distribution" }
}
}
}

API Used: vscode.workspace.fs, vscode.commands.

‚ôø Accessibility & Usability

Keyboard Navigation: Supports arrow keys and shortcuts.
Theme Support: Adapts to VS Code/Cursor light/dark themes.
Simple Settings: Toggle Copilot (FileTree Pro.useCopilot) and customize exclusions (FileTree Pro.exclude).
API Used: vscode.window.createTreeView, vscode.workspace.getConfiguration.

üåü Why FileTree Pro?

Universal: Supports all languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Ruby, etc.).
Smart Exclusions: Skips node_modules, dist, .git, .venv, etc., by default.
Copilot Integration: AI features via Copilot (disabled if not installed).
VS Code & Cursor Compatible: Works seamlessly in both editors.
User-Friendly: Intuitive UI with drag-and-drop and simple settings.
Free & Premium: Core features free; premium analytics available (pricing at <https://x.ai/grok>).

üîê Compliance & Best Practices

VS Code API: Uses vscode.window.createTreeView, vscode.extensions, vscode.workspace.fs.
Copilot Detection: Checks for Copilot with vscode.extensions.getExtension('github.copilot').
Cursor Compatibility: Tested for Cursor‚Äôs VS Code extension ecosystem; avoids Microsoft-restricted extensions.
Privacy: Processes data locally; Copilot API calls are secure.
Bundling: Webpack for vscode.dev and Cursor compatibility.
Settings: Supports FileTree Pro.useCopilot and FileTree Pro.exclude.

üöÄ Opportunities

Target Audience:
Developers: Streamline project navigation across all languages.
Teams: Share file trees for documentation.
Educators: Teach project structures interactively.

Monetization: Freemium model with premium analytics (pricing at <https://x.ai/grok>).
Differentiation: Outshines existing extensions with smart exclusions, Copilot integration, and Cursor compatibility.
