# 🚀 VS Code Extension CI/CD Pipeline - Complete Setup

## 🎉 What We've Built

You now have a **complete automated CI/CD pipeline** that will:

✅ **Build and test** your extension automatically
✅ **Package** into `.vsix` files
✅ **Publish** to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX Registry
✅ **Create GitHub releases** with attached binaries
✅ **Ensure quality** with automated testing (83 tests passing!)

## 📋 Next Steps (Action Required!)

### 1. Get Your Publishing Tokens 🔑

**VS Code Marketplace Token (VSCE_PAT):**

- Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com) → Personal Access Tokens
- Create token with `Marketplace (Publish)` scope
- Copy the token

**Open VSX Registry Token (OVSX_PAT):**

- Go to [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org) → Settings → Access Tokens
- Create token with `publish-extensions` scope
- Copy the token

### 2. Add GitHub Secrets 🔐

1. Go to **your repository** → Settings → Secrets and Variables → Actions
2. Click **"New repository secret"**
3. Add these secrets:

   ```
   Name: VSCE_PAT
   Secret: [your Azure DevOps token]

   Name: OVSX_PAT
   Secret: [your Open VSX token]
   ```

### 3. Create Production Environment 🛡️

1. Repository Settings → Environments
2. Click **"New environment"**
3. Name: `production`
4. Add **Required reviewers** (yourself)
5. Save protection rules

### 4. Test Your Pipeline 🧪

```bash
# Update version in package.json
npm version patch  # 0.1.93 → 0.1.94

# Push to main
git push origin main

# Create release to trigger full pipeline
git tag v0.1.94
git push origin v0.1.94

# Or use GitHub UI: Releases → Create new release
```

## 🔄 How the Pipeline Works

### Stage 1: 🧪 **Build & Test** (Always runs)

- ✅ Install dependencies with pnpm
- ✅ Compile TypeScript (`pnpm run compile`)
- ✅ Run all 83 tests (`pnpm test`)
- ✅ Basic linting check (temporarily simplified)

### Stage 2: 📦 **Package Extension** (Main branch + Releases)

- ✅ Create `.vsix` package using `vsce`
- ✅ Extract version information
- ✅ Upload as GitHub artifact (10-day retention)

### Stage 3: 🚀 **Publish to Marketplaces** (Releases only)

- ✅ **VS Code Marketplace**: `vsce publish`
- ✅ **Open VSX Registry**: `ovsx publish`
- ✅ **Requires approval** via production environment
- ✅ Runs in parallel for speed

### Stage 4: 📎 **GitHub Release** (Releases only)

- ✅ Attach `.vsix` file to GitHub release
- ✅ Available for manual downloads

## ⚡ Publishing Workflow

### **Automated Publishing** (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add awesome new feature"
git push origin main

# 2. When ready to release
npm version patch  # or minor/major
git push origin main

# 3. Create GitHub release
git tag v0.1.94
git push origin v0.1.94
# Pipeline automatically builds → packages → publishes! 🎉
```

### **Manual Publishing** (Fallback)

```bash
npm install -g @vscode/vsce ovsx
vsce package
vsce publish
ovsx publish *.vsix -p $OVSX_PAT
```

## 📊 Pipeline Features

### **Smart Triggers**

- **Push/PR**: Build and test only
- **Main branch**: Build, test, and package
- **Releases**: Full pipeline with publishing

### **Quality Gates**

- All tests must pass before packaging
- Manual approval required before publishing
- Error handling and rollback capabilities

### **Multi-Platform Publishing**

- VS Code Marketplace (primary)
- Open VSX Registry (for other editors)
- GitHub Releases (for manual installs)

## 🔍 Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### **Check Pipeline Status**

- GitHub → Actions tab
- Watch for ✅ green checkmarks or ❌ red X's

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

**"Authentication failed"**

```bash
# Check secrets are set correctly
# Verify tokens haven't expired
# Ensure publisher ID matches package.json
```

**"Pipeline stuck on approval"**

```bash
# Go to Actions → Your workflow run
# Click "Review deployments"
# Click "Approve and deploy"
```

**"Tests failing"**

```bash
# Run tests locally: pnpm test
# Check for TypeScript errors: pnpm run compile
# Fix issues before pushing
```

## 📈 What Happens After Setup

1. **You make changes** → Push to main
2. **Pipeline automatically** builds and tests
3. **When ready to release** → Create GitHub release
4. **Pipeline automatically** packages and publishes
5. **Users can install** from both marketplaces within minutes!
